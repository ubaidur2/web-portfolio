            <p>Myself Ubaidur Rahman and I am a positive and motivated individual who enjoys various aspects of life. I am an avid reader and love to get lost in the pages of a good novel. I also place a lot of emphasis on clear communication and enjoy speaking in a way that conveys my thoughts effectively. Additionally, I find inspiration in the simple things in life, such as watching the sunrise and enjoying a cup of tea.
        
                One of my favorite hobbies is writing short stories, as I love to express my creativity through words. I believe that self-improvement is important and strive to motivate myself every day to be the best version of myself. Overall, I am a person who values positivity self-expression, and finding joy in the small things
